This C program, running on an ATmega328P microcontroller, displays images on a 16-bit color display using color compression. The display operates in landscape mode throughout. Pixel data for a 140x76 image is stored in picture.c, with color information compressed via repetition and saved in the array Bild1. The program starts by initializing the display and filling the screen with a green background. A red rectangle matching the image size (140x76) is then centered. An algorithm subsequently replaces the rectangle with the decompressed image.
